    <div class="instruction">
        <b>Instructions:</b><br>The gift is hidden behind thirty seven layers. There are thirty seven questions. Upon each correct answer, a lawyer will be unveiled. Answer all to win. Hope you have fun. It took me twelve hours of nonstop work to create this game. The steps are as follows:
        <br>1. Start with the first question. The first charater of the answer to the question in uppercase forms the seed. Remember this seed.
        <br>2. Input this seed and hit Generate. Upon hitting generate, a layer will be unveiled and a new question will be generated.
        <br>3. Find the first character in uppercase of the answer to the new question. This is the new seed. 
        <br>4. Add the new seed to the old seed and hit generate again. This is the cycle.
        <br>5. Remember, the further you reach in the game, the longer the seed will become, keep the seed safe in order to restart the game where you left-off. Thats it!
        <br>Enjoy!
