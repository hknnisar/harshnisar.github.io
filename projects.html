			I have been developing system trading modules for personal use since Summer of 2020.
			<br>
			<h1>Projects</h1>
			I currently have two modules in <a href="project.html#Deployment"><u>deployment</u></a>. They are currently deployed at a fraction of the planned capital and are being rejigged and escalated at every expiry.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="KiteRange.html" title="KiteRange"><strong><u>KiteRange</u></strong></a>: Trades intraday range breakouts.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>KiteSwing</strong>: Takes positional trendfollowing trades.
				</li>
			</ul>
			Please go through the <a href="project.html#Stages"><u>context</u></a> below before proceeding.
			<br>
			<h1 id="Stages">
				Stages
			</h1>
			I have found that the developement cycle is roughly constituted of the following stages:
			<ul>
				<li>Research</li>
				<li>Testing</li>
				<li>Deployment</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Research</h2>
			Research provides the basis for system trading. It is the most resourse intensive stage. It involves the following:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Data Management: Involves maintaining robust historical price, volume, volatility, open interest etc. data adjusted for coroprate actions, at necessary time resolution.
				</li>
				<li>
					Strategies: Involves exploring trading strategies, for example, for speculators, it involves defining entry and exit points, profit-booking and stop-loss zones.
				</li>
				<li>
					Backtesting: Involves testing said defined strategies on historical data to determine optimum parameters, and projecting strategy risk and returns.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Testing</h2>
			Testing involves running the strategy for a probatory period on limited capital to get a measure of slippages and real world adherence to projected risk and returns. Testing at time begins with deployment of a quick and dirty script, which is gradually developed in a robust trading module. All edge cases are resolved. All user features are built in the testing stage.
			<h2 id="Deployment">Deployment</h2>
			With the backing of proven projected risk and returns, capital is allotted, preferably incrementally over a few expiry periods. Any bugs are ironed out before full capital is deployed. Each escalation of capital deployment includes re-backtesting with room being kept for delaying full deployment, or aborting the strategy if required as per updated re-backtest results.<br>A strategy which has performed within the projected risk and return parameters in all three market cycles is considered successfull.
